# libsm64-unity-bepinex

Modification of [libsm64-unity-melonloader](https://github.com/headshot2017/libsm64-unity-melonloader), intended for modding Unity games through [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx).

This template covers the adaption of libsm64-unity-melonloader so that it can be used as a Bepinex mod, however you must make some changes in order to adapt it to the game you want to mod.

* Create a new project in Visual Studio using the Bepinex template.
* Copy everything in this project into yours.

Don't forget to compile the libsm64 DLL itself as well. sm64.dll must be placed in the same directory as the game's exe.
